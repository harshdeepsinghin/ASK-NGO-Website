## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(150, 50%, 50%) -- Convert this verdant, balanced hue to #53c68c, symbolizing growth, compassion, and harmony, mirroring ASKâ€™s commitment to social upliftment. Do not suggest teal.
- Background color: HSL(150, 20%, 95%) -- Render a very light, desaturated version of the primary color, approximately #f0f9f4, ensuring a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that enhances readability and overall user experience.
- Accent color: HSL(120, 60%, 40%) -- Apply a closely related hue but with contrast: approx. #339933 (darker green), accentuating calls-to-action (CTAs) and vital information.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. The combination ensures readability and modern appeal for the content, supporting ease of use and engagement.
- Implement clear, meaningful icons that resonate with NGO activities; integrate these strategically to enhance content navigation and visual engagement. Prioritize recognition and accessibility to guarantee smooth user interaction.
- Focus on a clean, human-centered design by using white space, establishing a clear hierarchy of information, and making it effortless for the users to find key sections (like donation links and program descriptions).
- Integrate subtle, purposeful animations (like fading transitions or smooth scrolling) to enrich user engagement, all without compromising performance or accessibility.
